# This script simulates incoming calls by sending out
# pre-recorded messages that originally came from Voice-Ahn.
#
# It covers a lot of the Voice-stack functionality without creating
# actual SIP calls, so VoIP-related features as hangup/transfer
# are not possible.
#
# You may want to create some fake agents/customers before you start:
# > script/create-fake-agents
#
# Invoke it with the number of calls to be made:
# > script/replay-events 100
#
# When you login as admin or with the agent's credentials you will
# see the calls being queued and received.
# The number of simultaneous calls is primarily limited by the
# count of agents, because the script replays the call-sequence
# to an agent only once at a time.
